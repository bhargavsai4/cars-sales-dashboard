The dataset contains a wide variety of car models, from budget options like the Tata Nano to luxury vehicles like the Volvo XC90.
Mahindra Bolero variants are common in the dataset, indicating their popularity in the market.

Cars with fewer kilometers driven generally have higher selling prices. For example, a Volvo XC40 with only 20,000 km driven is priced much higher than older models with more kilometers.
High-kilometer cars, particularly those with over 100,000 km, see a significant drop in their resale value.
